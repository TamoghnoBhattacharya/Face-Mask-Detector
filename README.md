<h1 align="center">Face-Mask-Detector</h1>

The inspiration for this was taken from Adrian Rosebrock (PyImageSearch). This project aims to detect 
whether a person is wearing a mask or not. It is implemented in Python using Keras and OpenCV. 
This is a part of a Hackathon "Chef's Hack" conducted by CodeChef SRM Team held during 31st October-1st November 2020.

## Motivation
In the COVID-19 crisis wearing masks is absolutely necessary for public health and controlling the spread of the pandemic. 
So, what if we could have a system that could monitor and supervise people complying with the safety measures like wearing of the masks.
Currently, there is no efficient face mask detection applications available for ensuring public safety. 

## :warning: Framework(s) used

- [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/)
- [Keras](https://keras.io/)

## :file_folder: Dataset
There are a few different datasets available for this project on the internet, I have used the one from <br>[Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/ashishjangra27/face-mask-12k-images-dataset).
But we will be modifying it as per our convinience so as to add some noise in the data along with some corrections like bearded faces and people wearing glasses.
